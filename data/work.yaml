    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Implementing <b>counter-measures</b> to protect the company
        from external attacks.
      </li>
      <li>Modernizing our <b>secrets management</b> pipeline.</li>
      <li>
        Building <b>internal tools</b> to monitor unexpected uses of
        the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixing <b>security issues</b> in all platforms (backend,
        mobile and web).
      </li>
      <li>Securing our emails using <b>DMARC</b>.</li>
    </ul>

      While in Sketch, I had the opportunity to learn modern web
      development in <b>Typescript</b> and <b>React</b>. I implemented
      multi-account, SSO sign in, worked on the design system and
      helped revamping the render framework. However, my main take
      away from my time in Sketch was learning how to work in a truly
      <b>distributed company</b>.

    <p class="mt0">
      Karumi was my first consultant role where I had the chance to
      expand my reach. I worked directly with clients in their
      projects, sharing my expertise with them while
      <b>learning what building a product really meant</b> for all
      teams involved: design, data, product, business, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the opportunity to give talks and courses on advanced
      topics like <b>screenshot testing</b> or
      <b>how to build public APIs</b>. Finally, I contributed to many
      open-source projects like

      When I joined Tuenti, I worked primarily on the
      <b>PHP backend</b>, developing tools and features for the
      support team. I changed teams to work on the chat and I
      specialized on the <b>VoIP stack with WebRTC</b>. I integrated
      full VoIP capabilities in the chat for the web. I ended up
      helping implement the <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b> versions as
      well and took the opportunity to learn mobile development in the
      process.
